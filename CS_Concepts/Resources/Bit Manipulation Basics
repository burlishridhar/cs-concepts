Bit Manipulation Basics
**************************************

In general, an integer variable is used for bit manipulation. Depending on the programming
language used, this may translate to different number of bits.

For C++, int = 16 bits
For Java, int = 32 bits

So if the bits by themselves are indicators of a particular element being present or absent,
then only 32 or 16 such elements can be considered. In other words, think of the integers
as a set of elements.

Let A and B be any two sets represented by integers

UNION			: A | B
INTERSECTION	: A & B
SUBTRACTION		: A & ~B
NEGATION		: ~A

SET A BIT AT X			: A |= 1 << X
CLEAR BIT AT X			: A &= ~(1 << X)
TEST BIT AT X			: ( A & 1 << X ) != 0
